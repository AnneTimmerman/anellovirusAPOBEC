Control of human anelloviruses by cytosine to uracil genome editing

The fasta files available in this repository refer to the article "Control of human anelloviruses by cytosine to uracil genome editing". The fasta files contain C to T edited anellovirus scaffolds and LoFreq variants found in seep sequenced blood samples from two individuals (#1 and #2) followed-up for more than 30 years. R script for creating a sequence logo and variants positions over time are also included.

The fasta files available in this repository refer to the article "The control of human anelloviruses by C to T genome editing". The fasta files contain C to T edited anellovirus scaffolds and LoFreq variants found in seep sequenced blood samples from two individuals (#1 and #2) followed-up for more than 30 years. R script for creating a sequence logo and variants positions over time are also included.
